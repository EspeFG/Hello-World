##CREATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT 

#1.	Create a virtual environment for a project:

$ cd my_project_folder
$ virtualenv my_project

#2. source my_project/bin/activate

$(my_project)Your-Computer:your_projectÂ UserName$)


#3. Deactivate

-Don't forget to install the right version of every program 
you are going to need inside the virtual environment you have created. 
Otherwise it will default to the ones outside the venv.
